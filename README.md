The Two Speed Standard
Where This Came From, Why It Exists, and What I Hope Happens Next

This started the way most real ideas start: by accident.

I was thinking through an electric conversion idea and doing rough math on motor sizes, torque curves, gearboxes, and cost. Over and over, I kept landing on the same uncomfortable conclusion. The complexity on the torque side of modern vehicles feels… optional. Self-inflicted. Like we kept adding layers because that’s where the industry learned to compete, not because physics demanded it.

The math kept saying the same thing: a medium-sized torque plant and an industrial gearbox could do the work. The problem was never “can it work.” The problem was always compromise. You could tune it for torque or tune it for speed, but doing both cleanly meant piling on parts.

Then, while looking for a donor chassis for a completely separate project, I stumbled across a 1950s two-speed rear axle.

And it clicked.

The exact gear delta I was trying to manufacture elsewhere had already existed for a hundred years. Quietly. Reliably. In work trucks that were expected to run forever.

Everything that follows is just me refusing to let that realization go.

------------------------------------
This Is Not an Electric Project
And It’s Not a Combustion Project Either

I was thinking about electric motors when this started. I’m not hiding that.
This work is not about electric vehicles, diesel trucks, gasoline engines, or ideology.

It is about torque.

Specifically, it is about power plants that can deliver useful torque across a wide, honest operating range, without relying on excessive gearing, complexity, or fragile abstraction to make them livable.

If a power plant can do that, it belongs here.

That can look like many things:
	- Combustion engines, simple or complex
	- Electric motors, large or small
	- Hybrid arrangements, conventional or unconventional
	- Power sources that run full time, part time, or only when needed
	- Systems that are mechanically controlled, digitally controlled, or somewhere in between

Fuel type, cylinder count, control strategy, and era are not the point.

Those are implementation details.

The drivetrain should not care where torque comes from, only that it arrives in a form that can be multiplied, shared, disconnected, and sustained.
This work is intentionally torque-agnostic.

It does not ask anyone to abandon what they know.

It asks them to stop assuming their preferred solution is the only valid one.

If that framing makes someone uncomfortable, that discomfort is probably useful.

------------------------------------
Why There Are Multiple Papers

This isn’t one idea. It’s a stack.

I separated this into multiple documents on purpose, because mixing rules, hardware, and imagination always ends badly.

Here’s how to read them:
	- This Read Me explains how the idea was born and how I hope it lives.
	- The Two-Speed Ford 9” Third Member is the first real, buildable step.
	- The Two Speed Standard defines the rules, questions, and transparency metrics.
	- Peripheral Modules explores what naturally follows once the core exists.
	- Applications and Possibilities is where imagination is allowed to run.

If you skip ahead without understanding the rules, you’ll miss the point.

About Ownership, Money, and Credit

I’m not trying to own this.

There is no licensing scheme, no royalty expectation, and no business model hiding in the margins. If someone builds something from this and makes money, that’s fine. That’s how the real world works.

Attribution would be nice.

Not because I need control, but because ideas have lineage. If this spreads, I’d like the origin to stay traceable. That’s all.

About Me, and Why I’m Not Leading This

I don’t know everything. That’s not humility theater, it’s just true.

I’ve spent my life working around broken automation and controls systems by finding workarounds that weren’t “supposed” to exist. This feels like the same muscle, applied to drivetrains instead of buildings, devices, or controls.

I’m not the right person to take this to its logical end.

I can start fires. I’m good at seeing connections. I’m good at asking the wrong questions in rooms that need them. But this will need builders, machinists, engineers, and stubborn people who like getting grease under their nails more than winning arguments online.

If someone picks this up and runs with it, that’s success.

------------------------------------
Engagement, If You Want It

I’m open to talking about this.

Not in comment wars, not in drive-by dismissals, and not in “that’s not how it’s done” conversations. If you’ve read the papers, thought seriously about them, modeled something, built something, or even broken something trying, I’m happy to talk.

Effort is the only filter.

------------------------------------
A Living Thing, Not a Finished One

The Two Speed Standard is intentionally unfinished.

It’s meant to evolve as people build under it and discover what works, what doesn’t, and what needs to be clarified. The standards should live where the work lives, not with me.

I’m putting this out because I need it out of my head.

What happens next isn’t up to me.

------------------------------------
Final Thought

If this feels obvious in hindsight, good.

If it feels uncomfortable, also good.

If it breaks physics, it should die quickly.

If it doesn’t, then there’s work to do.
